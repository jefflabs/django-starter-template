# What is Python Decouple

Python Decouple: Strict separation of settings from code
Decouple helps you to organize your settings so that you can change parameters without having to redeploy your app.

It also makes it easy for you to:

* store parameters in ini or .env files;
* define comprehensive default values;
* properly convert values to the correct data type;
* have only one configuration module to rule all your instances.

For how to install and use it, see -> https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/
