# Django starter app

## Overview

The Django starter project comes with a Django starter app consisting of

* a static homepage
* dynamic profile pages
* allauth for user authentication
* settings page (using Htmx)
* 404 page

This way you can fast track your new app. Since most apps need a static homepage and user onboarding and a user profile page.

Each of these items can be changed easily.

## Used Libraries

The following libraries are used

* Django
* pillow -> for uploading images
* django-cleanup -> for cleaning up duplicate images
* django-allauth -> for login and signup of users
* django-htmx -> for htmx (hypermedia) support

## Apps

There are 2 apps:

* app_users
* app_home

Note: We start our apps with "app_". This way all our apps lign up at the top of our project folder. Otherwise they are scattered around.

## App Home

pass

## App Users
